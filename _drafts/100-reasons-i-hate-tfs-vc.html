<p>Team Foundation Server has a version control system that is an improved version of SourceSafe, which is like the devil having a makeover.</p>
<p>In the name of explaining why project's should avoid TFS-VC in favour of at the very least TFS's git hosting here's a list of nasty papercuts that add up to a shitty dev experience and damage to the software held therein. This is largely subjective but should give you an idea of the scale of the problems it has.</p>
<p>There are some workarounds and practices for avoiding some of these pains. Offline workspaces is terrible though so doesn't compensate for anything.</p>
<ol>
<li>Editing a file requires a server checkout. WTF.</li>
<li>It has some kind of cached idea of what's on disk. Just read the damn filesystem FFS. Gets out of sync any time any time an oxygen atom hits your PC.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Adding a file to a project results in an "Add Progress" progress bar in a modal dialog while TFS gets in your way. Jarringly breaking your chain of thought.</li>
<li>Get latest... "Automatically resolved conflict ... As AutoMerge". But what did it do?...</li>
</ol>
