It's not twitter (broadcast).<br />It's not email (more built in understanding of the purpose).<br />It's not personal messenger (more of a queue based system).<br />It's not facebook (though it could be a facebook app).<br />But could make use of all of the above.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />xml format<br /><br />Receiver:<br /><ul><li> small app showing your in tray</li><li> 3 people sent you this url: ... (expand)</li><li> fred thought you'd like this url: ...., fred's message (why you care)</li><li> twitter like choice of ways of receiving. email / sms / jabber / special app</li><li> method for feeding back to sender in order of difficulty: thumbs up/down, fixed responses [send more like this, don't send more like this, mildly interesting, didn't understand, what am i supposed to be looking at, etc ], rating </li></ul><br />Sender:<br /><ul><li> enter url:</li><li> enter message:</li><li> select people to send to (individuals or predefined groups)</li><li> public/private per message (choose default)<br /></li><li>discoverable, subscribeable channels eg tech, linux, money (like tags)<br /></li></ul>Centralised vs. peer to peer:<br />Centralised - always there, hosting costs etc<br />Peer to peer - no loss of control over private data.<br />Not quite either/or. De-centralised but with the option to use hosting, like git and github. After all we don't all run a server or leave our machine permanently on so can't always service requests.<br />
