On the subject of central synchronisation for Linux desktops.<br /><br />The standard way of keeping centralised copies of home directories for linux desktops is as far as I can gather to mount them via NFS, <br /><br />For desktops that are always connected to the network where there is a file server that is always available, this is a perfectly reasonable option. However for laptops which sometimes will and sometimes won't be connected, a different solution is needed.<br /><br />I've spent a lot of time trying out options and thinking about this, and currently I find no options that do the job to my complete satisfaction.<br /><br />The nicest solution I have found so far is using unison to synchronise manually.<br /><br />It is difficult to set up linux to synchronise the user's home directory when they log in &amp; out.<br /><br />Rsync is good for background sync.<br /><br />Unison is a great tool, but requires a large amount of setup to get everything right.<br /><br />Something that windows does that linux does not currently do is have a separation in profiles between things that should be synchronised and things that shouldn't. This largely manifests itself as a "Local Settings" (i.e. don't synchronise) folder in the user's profile that will not by default be copied to/from the file server when the user logs in &amp; out. <br /><br />More on active directory &amp; linux: <a href="http://reverendted.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/linux-goes-mad/">http://reverendted.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/linux-goes-mad/</a><br /><br />So what needs to be done?<br /><br />Maybe we need some more work to be done on the server side of linux for managing desktops &amp; laptops.<br /><br />Perhaps we need a standard to be set that allows applications to explain to a synchronisation system what should and shouldn't be synchronised, and maybe even when it is safe to run a synchronisation.<br /><br />Something like a .local folder, or a text file that states which files/folders should and shouldn't be synchronised.<br /><br />Applications then need to follow this standard and make sure things like cached data are not included in synchronisation.<br /><br />We also need user friendly setup of this synchronisation to a central file server.
