old strategy<br /><br />massive pile of commits, attempt to rebase<br /><br />problems<br /><br /><br />new strategy<br /><br />howto<br />• make all fixes &amp; formatting things you do as part of your work separate branches based on master<br />∘ this prevents these patches relying on your main work to be merged<br />• then octopus merge them all and base your work on that<br />∘ so you can make use of them locally<br />• get the unrelated fixes cr'd first and in, then go for the big one?<br />∘ or<br />• or create a straight-line history that includes them all and cr the whole thing
