<p>I've been looking for my next .NET contract recently so I've been spending a lot of time dealing with the day-to-day hassle of searching for and keeping track of my leads, along with dealing with a small army of variable quality recruitment firms. Once again I find myself thinking I'd pay someone to do a lot of this for me, if I could get the new contract even a day earlier, or get a fractionally higher rate (by doing a better job finding work or being a better negotiator) then it could easily pay for itself, just like the accountants I use free up my time to concentrate on my business.</p>
<p>So I did some research, and found <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/">10x</a> - who make some rather bold claims such as the start of "Our Mission" on the <a href="https://www.10xmanagement.com/aboutus/">10x about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10x exists for one simple reason: to revolutionize the way the world does business</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, good luck with that. Sheesh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I initially thought I'd found the answer, an agent to do all the leg-work so I can concentrate on doing actual coding work for clients.</p>
<p>https://flic.kr/p/SYQSYf</p>
<p>What wasn't immediately obvious is that their model is to take a percentage of your contract rate / salary which is the same as most 3rd party recruiters.</p>
<blockquote><p>10x Management, on the other hand, gets a cut of your hourly rate...<br />
... I feel that eliminating the burden of the administrative drudgery that comes with freelancing is alone well worth their cut</p>
<p>~ dristoph</p></blockquote>
<p>So <a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3639629&amp;cid=43428695">dristoph's comment on slashdot</a> tells us how it works financially, and shows that I'm not the only contractor who thinks a service in this area has value.</p>
<p>In fact they are struggling to find work for the rockstars (shudder) they already have on their Rolodex:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Exactly how we tap into the pipeline of companies and startups that need us is still something we’re nailing down,” he said. “We haven’t figured out where the fire hose is.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price">The New Yorker article about 10x</a> that 10x still link to in their site's header. (Even though it's a three year old article)</p>
<p>They also only cover a few cities, and only operate in America, so I suspect that like many other third-party recruiters they are building a few lucrative relationships with a manageable number of hiring-companies and easily marketable programmers. That's fine for them but that implies they can't serve the much wider market of developers who want to get the best jobs and rates that they can for minimal time-cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10x has been covered at least three times on the mighty (and time-consuming) slashdot with many insightful comments underneath each:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/04/11/2216236/top-coders-tell-agents-show-me-the-money</li>
<li>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/11/18/0025237/do-good-programmers-need-agents</li>
<li>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/15/02/24/1347246/attention-rockstar-developers-get-a-talent-agent</li>
</ul>
<p>The hype machine continues. The 10x website changes every time I look at it. The list of cities gone, so-called 10x'er profiles have been added.</p>
<p>In my personal experience in order to find the optimal contract given my current employee count of one I have to use a broad search, and that includes dealing with third-party recruiters.</p>
