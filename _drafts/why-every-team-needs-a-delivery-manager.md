title: Why every team needs a Delivery Manager (DM)
description: The modern agile dev team has a new structure

I was explaining to someone the team structure I was working withing at the
Department for Education's [DfE Digital](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/)
organisation and realised not everyone has seen this structure at work and the
magic it brings.


In short it looks something like this:

* Product Manager
* Delivery Manager
* Developer(s)
* User Researcher(s)
* Content Designer(s)
* Interaction Designer(s)

This is modelled after [the structure of a team at the Government Digital
Service
](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team)(GDS)

The structure I more commonly see in commercial teams is:

* Project Manager
* Business Analyist (BA)
* SCRUM Master (in title if not in deed)
* Developer(s)
* Testers(s) / QA (Quality Assurance)

I've seen good and not so good people in all of the roles, but I think the
GDS-style team structure is superior when it comes to shipping user-value as a
development team.

# Product who?

The Product Manager is more widely known in industry as Product Owner. This is
someone who figures out the balance of features in a service and the software
that supports it, based on all the various constraints and inputs (e.g. user
need, security, stability, internal need). One output of this role is
prioritization of work.

# DM for the win

The role I want to focus on here (though they are all awesome) is Delivery
Manager as it's the most uncommon in my experience.

In any organisation beyond about 20 people the bureaucracy starts to sneek in,
layers of rules are added as a business tries to avoid repeating previous
mistakes, and as you hit enterprise scale it's positively stifling, to the
point that people issues and inability to open Microsoft Word on a work
computer without signing 3 forms in blood become nearly impossible. The thing
is for a dev team is they are usually building something that hasn't been built
before, maybe as part of a major change to how the organisation functions. Web
development is more than just taking your sales brochures and putting them
online, if that was all we wanted I'd give you a copy of Wordpress and find
something else to build. Sometimes you can hide the team away in a
[skunkworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) project, but that can't
last forever and eventually the old meets the new and sparks fly. The
productivity can be sucked out of a development team for good, they can end up
unable to deliver anything. This is where a delivery manager role is golden,
they deal with making sure the organisations goals to have this new service /
system / product / software are able to be progressed, conversations & endless
meetings had, finance obtained, hardware procured, forms filled, security
audits managed sensibly, pile-on demands defended ... the list is endless. By
having this role the team can focus on building and shipping, comfortable that
they won't be sidetracked or blocked.

The approach is not new, Joel wrote this in 2000:

> Compare this to Microsoft, where things are done at the lowest level, and
> most managers act like their most important job is to run around the room,
> moving the furniture out of the way, so people can concentrate on their work.

but I've never seen it called out as a specific role like this outside UK Government.
