description: The modern agile dev team has a new structure

I was explaining to someone the team structure I was working withing at the
Department for Education's [DfE Digital](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/)
organisation and realised not everyone has seen this structure at work and the
magic it brings.


In short it looks something like this:

* Product Manager
* Delivery Manager
* Developer(s)
* User Researcher(s)
* Content Designer(s)
* Interaction Designer(s)

This is modelled after [the structure of a team at the Government Digital
Service
](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team)(GDS)

The structure I more commonly see in commercial teams is:

* Project Manager
* Business Analyist (BA)
* SCRUM Master (in title if not in deed)
* Developer(s)
* Testers(s) / QA (Quality Assurance)

I've seen good and not so good people in all of the roles, but I think the
GDS-style team structure is superior when it comes to shipping user-value as a
development team.

# Product who?

The Product Manager is more widely known in industry as Product Owner. This is
someone who figures out the balance of features in a service and the software
that supports it, based on all the various constraints and inputs (e.g. user
need, security, stability, internal need). One output of this role is
prioritization of work.

# DM for the win

The role I want to focus on here (though they are all awesome) is Delivery
Manager as it's the most uncommon in my experience.
