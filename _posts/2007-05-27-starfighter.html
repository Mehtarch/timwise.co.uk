So I installed it. Then ran it. And played it. It's rather good fun. Ctrl to fire lasers, space to fire rockets, cursors to get around. Spend your time chasing enemy ships around the screen, and collecting bonuses / money. Has a decent sound track too.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I love the open source world.<br /><br /><br /><code><br />$ apt-cache show starfighter<br />Package: starfighter<br />Priority: optional<br />Section: universe/games<br />Installed-Size: 368<br />Maintainer: Debian Games Team <pkg-games-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org><br />Architecture: i386<br />Version: 1.1-6<br />Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4-1), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.0), libsdl-image1.2 (>= 1.2.3), lib<br />sdl-mixer1.2 (>= 1.2.6), libsdl1.2debian (>> 1.2.7+1.2.8), libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.0)<br />, starfighter-data (= 1.1-6)<br />Filename: pool/universe/s/starfighter/starfighter_1.1-6_i386.deb<br />Size: 116320<br />MD5sum: 959f894e78517a3411c3c2656d61b85c<br />SHA1: ac7e2f458d4bd8c57056e11bb3da8609f35b528c<br />SHA256: 29c9adee1ee2fb52f1d790254683579e919655ad01bb806a02a59d32abcb8d58<br />Description: 2D scrolling shooter game<br /> After decades of war one company, who had gained powerful supplying both<br /> sides with weaponary, steps forwards and crushes both warring factions<br /> in one swift movement.
