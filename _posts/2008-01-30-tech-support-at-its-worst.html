As you may know, I'm working through a Microsoft e-learning course at the moment. Having had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2206580619&amp;size=o">few problems</a> with the service I've been trying to extract some common sense from their support services. Having failed to get anything vaguely helpful I thought I'd ask them about who they were, and I think the following response really sums up the level of idiocy I have encountered thus far.<br /><br />When asked a simple direct question about who I was communicating with, the response is either hilarious or depressing, I'm not sure which. It would seem that before they can tell me where they are based, they need to know what operating system I run, what version of flash I have, what my login is etc etc. Talk about customer disservice. The finishing touch for me is the addition of upbeat advertising added to a response to an evidently already irritated customer.<br /><br />Here are the last two messages for your entertainment (identifiers stripped out):<br /><blockquote><br />-------- Original Message --------<br />Subject:  Re: MCP Ref: C ###### \ site broken.

As far as I can fathom, the e-learning system has been set up on a pile of servers and then been left to rot whilst paying customers are fobbed off by a nameless and faceless 3rd party. It may be profitable in the short term, but this kind of behaviour may well be the cracks in the foundations of Microsoft's empire. I for one am certainly plotting a course for fairer pastures.
