Congratulations to Joel Mansford, a good friend of mine, and his company <a href="http://www.provenworks.com/">Proven Works</a> on getting the <a href="http://joelmansford.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/new-utility-to-shutdown-your-network-pcs-at-night/">first release</a> of <a href="http://www.nightlyshutdown.com/">Nightly Shutdown</a> out of the door.<br /><br />This looks to be a great product and hopefully will make system administrators' lives easier and greener. It's a utility for ensuring that the computers are off when you want them to be, and can be deployed through active directory making the sys admin's life easier. There's a 10 PC free trial available, so check it out at the <a href="http://www.nightlyshutdown.com/DownloadRequest.aspx">download page</a>.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.nightlyshutdown.com/"><img src="http://www.timwise.co.uk/images/blog/nightly-shutdown.png" alt="Nightly Shutdown poster" style="border: medium none ;" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br />Without even looking I know this will be a good product and fantastically well supported. Best of luck to all at Proven Works, and to all the potential users and buyers out there, don't forget to check it out and provide any feedback you can.<br /></div></div>
