I've created a wiki at <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">wikispaces.com</a>, to document things that are less transient than a blog entry.<br /><br />Take a look at <a href="http://timwise.wikispaces.com/">http://timwise.wikispaces.com/</a><br /><br />I've started adding information about the car pc, and won't make any promises about what else I'll be adding (personal motto: under promise, over deliver).<br /><br />I've made it open to all editors, and licensed under the GNU Free documentation licence to ensure the maximum value, reach and participation.
