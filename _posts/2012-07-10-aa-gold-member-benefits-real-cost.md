<span style="background-color: white;"><b>Breakdown cover maths</b></span><br /><br />So, I'm getting rather fed up with the AA taking the michael every year with their renewals. Yes, I gather the RAC are just as bad but I think they need to realise their customers aren't stupid, know exactly what they are playing at, and can do the maths.<br /><br />I want to highlight what I think is a particularly dirty trick, making something look like a free perk when it's anything but.<br /><br /><b>So here's some numbers:</b><br /><br />This is for a single car policy covering Roadside, Home Start and Relay starting July 2012 paying annually for a year up front. (The monthly option is 10% more expensive, go figure). Numbers rounded to pounds.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li><span style="background-color: white;">Renewal through the post: </span><b style="background-color: white;">£135</b></li><li><span style="background-color: white;">Matching </span><a href="http://www.rac.co.uk/uk-breakdown/" style="background-color: white;">RAC cover</a><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;(checked online &amp; by phone): </span><b style="background-color: white;">£101</b></li><li><a href="http://www.theaa.com/breakdown-cover/uk-breakdown/view-options.do?optMshp=vcon300" style="background-color: white;">AA online price</a><span style="background-color: white;"> for new customers: </span><b style="background-color: white;">£92</b><span style="background-color: white;"> &nbsp;-&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">(so much for 6 years loyalty, a </span><b style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: red;">£43</span></b><span style="background-color: white;"> kick in the teeth)</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white;">AA phone price: </span><b style="background-color: white;">£116</b></li><li><span style="background-color: white;">AA phone price <i>without gold membership "benefits"</i>: </span><b style="background-color: white;">£89</b></li></ul><br /><b><br /></b><br />That means, the AA are pricing their gold benefits at <b><span style="color: red;">£27</span></b> even though they look like they are free on the renewal letter! Some cheek.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A4lqKF45sig/T_x3sQI1LxI/AAAAAAAAAHE/b0U0t-K1vZE/s1600/20120710_001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="207" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A4lqKF45sig/T_x3sQI1LxI/AAAAAAAAAHE/b0U0t-K1vZE/s400/20120710_001.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I queried the details of this so called benefit and established the following:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul><li><i>"Accident Management"</i> - means being towed by the AA after an accident (something you may be covered for under your car insurance policy)</li><li><i>European Breakdown Cover</i> - only useful if you are going abroad (obviously), did you really want to be paying for it?</li><li><i>"Family Associates Cover for under 17s"</i> - something about teenagers, I don't have any so not very useful to me</li><li><i>Key Insurance</i>&nbsp;- this could be valuable, but £27/year sounds like very expensive insurance to me even though they are expensive items to replace.</li><li><i>Legal Advice</i>&nbsp;- <b>Included as standard!</b> So not a gold benefit at all. Weasels.</li><li><i>Technical Advice</i>&nbsp;- <b>Included as standard!</b>&nbsp;See above. Still weasels.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>So it turns out that the supposed discount of <b>£44.90</b> on the posted renewal was actually a&nbsp;<b><span style="color: red;">£46</span></b> insult to my intelligence.</div><br /><br />I'm no money saving expert, but that's outrageous.
