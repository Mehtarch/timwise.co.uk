Just a quick post;<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: large;">href="#" &nbsp; ==&gt; &nbsp; href="#todo"</span></div><br />I'd like to promote a change to the habit of using '#' as the placeholder for a the url of a new hyperlink when you don't yet know where it'll link to: instead set the href to "#todo". This follows the //todo pattern recognised for unfinished code, and means you can now search your codebase for any links you forgot to finish off.<br /><br /><code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;new link&lt;/a&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;becomes<br />&lt;a href="<b>#todo</b>"&gt;new link&lt;/a&gt;</code><br /><div>eg: <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5082828566240519947#">new link</a> becomes <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5082828566240519947#todo">new link</a><br /><br />Give all these links an alert with the following (cheers to unknown in the comments)<br /><br /><code>$("a[href=#todo]").click(function () { alert('Not implemented yet.') });</code><br /><br /></div>It will also give clues to any sharp-eyed testers / users that they should report a bug for you as the url will change to #todo when the unfinished link is clicked. It can often be seen in the status bar too.<br />This has the handy side-effect of avoiding the annoying jump to the top of the page that is the default behaviour when you click on a # link that's a placeholder.<br /><hr /><div>For bonus points another little trick I like is to add a click handler with an alert to make it really obvious to any early users / testers that this is not done yet, and I've found this saves a lot of questions when you genuinely haven't finished, and also guarantees a quick bug report when you should have (not that I ever forget any of course :-D) </div><br /><code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;new link&lt;/a&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;becomes<br />&lt;a href="<b>#todo</b>" onclick="<b>alert('Not Implemented');</b>"&gt;new link&lt;/a&gt;</code><br /><div>eg:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5082828566240519947#">new link</a>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5082828566240519947#todo" onclick="alert('Not Implemented');">new link</a>&nbsp; <i>&lt;= click this to see the alert</i></div><br />Simple and effective.<br /><br />If you agree, please help spread the word. Perhaps by retweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_abell/status/338235507203002368">my tweet</a><br /><br /><hr /><br />P.S. This goes hand in hand with a technique of picking points during development at which there should be no todo's left in your codebase with the exception of those with references to outstanding user story / bug numbers. I suggest before marking a user story as done, and at the end of each sprint as good points to review all todos in your codebase.<br /><br />Further reading:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/todo">The case against TODO - wordaligned.org</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2012/10/managing-todo/">Using a JetBrains IDE to manage todos</a></li></ul>
