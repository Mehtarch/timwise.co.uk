Hello dear readers,<br /><br />I've started working on a data brower for relational databases that allows you to click through ids with foreign-keys to get around.<br /><br />Take a look at <a href="http://www.timwise.co.uk/sdv/">http://www.timwise.co.uk/sdv/</a> and if you think you might be interested then please do sign up to my <a href="http://eepurl.com/bDGPjf" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, and let me know if you have any feedback.<br /><br />This started as a holiday exercise in learning google's go programming language, but is intended to become a fully-fledged software product available to buy.<br /><br />Tim
