<p>I need somewhere to keep the marketing site/content for my new <a href="https://sqldataviewer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sql Data Viewer</a> product.</p>
<p>I could use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github pages</a> or something similar, but I've found the overhead of needing a dev environment to make any change puts me off getting things done. I've been using wordpress.com for this blog and am pretty happy, especially having a mobile app. I've also heard using wordpress makes it easier to outsource content/design if you have enough success to make that worthwhile.</p>
<p>I don't fancy maintenance, security patching and backup, so the marketing site is currently on <strong><a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a></strong> where I've paid for the "personal" plan at <strong>£3/month</strong> to remove ads and the <strong>£0.92/month</strong> for mapping a domain. Affordable for contactor running a shot-in-the-dark startup side-project that may never make a penny.</p>
<p>This is on top of the <strong>£1.15/month</strong> for domain registration and <strong>£10/month</strong> for a VPS (virtual private server) to run my demo site from, both from the excellent <a href="https://www.bytemark.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bytemark</a> hosting company, who've been fab on support from day one.</p>
<p>Just for completeness: the demo site connects to sql azure instances are easily within the $40/month included with my MSDN Professional subscription that I use for contracting. Handy.</p>
<p>I've been listening to lots of startup podcasts (<a href="mailto:tim@timwise.co.uk?subject=startup-podcasts&amp;body=send-me-your-opml!">email me</a> if you want the list), and have discovered the mighty <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/">Justin Jackson</a> and his excellent <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing for Developers</a> content - I recommend you buy it if you're a developer thinking of selling a product / service. I'm now working through trying to apply the lessons in the book to my own product. I got to the analytics bit and hit a wall. Wordpress.com (the wordpress hosting site, not the software itself) force you to upgrade to the business plan at <strong>£20.83/month</strong>. Given I don't know how long this is going to take me I'm not keen to start ramping up costs to that extent with no obvious route to a return on the investment.</p>
<p>I've looked at the three recommended in Justin's book, and the starting prices are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wpengine.com/plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPEngine</a>: Personal $29/month - about <strong>£22/month</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pagely.com/plans-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pagely</a>: VPS-1 $499/month - about <strong>£380/month</strong> - ouch! I don't think I'm their target market. I wonder if they repriced, perhaps Justin should drop this one from the book.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.siteground.co.uk/wordpress-hosting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siteground</a>: Startup plan (like it!) <strong>£2.75/month</strong> - looks like this might be a winner then! Oh wait, that's a sign-up discount, it's actually <strong>£6.95/month</strong>. Hrumph.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's where I'm at right now. Maybe I'll just shove a docker wordpress image on the VPS, it's already a docker host. I need to figure out hosting multiple sites on one IP for the demos anyway. But then again, I don't want to be a wordpress sys-admin. Or maybe I'll rethink the static site thing.</p>
