<p>Okay maybe a billion is a long shot, but I read the Hiten Shah article on <a href="https://producthabits.com/why-trello-failed-to-build-a-1-billion-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Trello could have been a $1B business</a> (via <a href="https://thestartupchat.com/ep258/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup chat</a>) and was surprised to discover there are lessons for how I can turn <a href="https://sqldataviewer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sql Data Viewer</a> into a sustainable business.</p>
<p>What trello and SDV have in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mass (horizontal) appeal</li>
<li>Easily copied</li>
<li>Difficult to sell premium versions of the general purpose product ("stickers" anyone?)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was going to just sell SDV for Â£100 and be done with it, but this article showed me a better way.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give the general purpose tool away for free (as Trello does)</li>
<li>Collect contact information in exchange for the value provided by the free tool.</li>
<li>Use the contact list to have conversations with businesses that use it in order to...</li>
<li>Find out how integrating tightly with their business could provide real value over and above the general purpose tool.</li>
<li>Build vertical-specific integrations, stickyness &amp; marketing.</li>
<li>Profit! (No underpants required. Or gnomes.)</li>
</ol>
