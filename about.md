Hi, I'm Tim Abell (one of many, but not the
[actor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008543/) or the [other software
dev](https://twitter.com/timabell)).

* I build software.
* I'm based near Reading, UK.
* I like helping our government do [better digital
  things](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology).
* I'm interested in [entreprenuership](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/)
  and the entire story of software and business.
* I like working in smart, agile teams who don't take any shit.
* I like working solo.
* I created the not yet very popular [SQL Schema
  Explorer](http://schemaexplorer.io/>).
* I created the fairly popular [ef-enum-to-lookup nuget
  package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ef-enum-to-lookup).
